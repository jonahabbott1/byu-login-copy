# PhishGuard: Interactive Phishing Awareness Demo

An educational cybersecurity project demonstrating real-world phishing techniques and detection strategies

---

## Overview

PhishGuard is a hands-on phishing awareness demonstration created as part of the IT&C 266 Final Project at Brigham Young University. The goal of this project is to help users recognize modern phishing attacks by simulating realistic scam emails and fake login pages in a safe, non-malicious environment.

Despite widespread awareness of phishing, many users still fall victim. This project demonstrates why — by showing how convincing modern scams can be.

- Teach users to identify common red flags  
- Show how attackers exploit:
  - Cognitive biases  
  - Logical fallacies  
  - Urgency tactics  
- Provide realistic examples without collecting real credentials

- Realistic phishing email simulation  
- Fake login page replica for demonstration  
- Hidden indicators for users to discover  
- Breakdown of scam techniques including:
  - Typos and grammar mistakes  
  - Incorrect branding  
  - Misleading links  
  - Generic messaging  
  - Urgency pressure  
  - Slightly altered URLs  
  - Unusual hosting locations

## Demo Breakdown

### 1. Phishing Email

Users analyze a fake email posing as a BYU housing message. Indicators include:

- Spoofed sender address  
- Typos and formatting errors  
- Fake personalization  
- Incorrect branding  
- Misleading sign-in link  
- Generic information  
- Urgency language

- URL closely mimics the real domain  
- Limited site functionality  
- Hosting location inconsistent with organization  
- Browser does not recognize the site  
- Autofill does not activate
